# WordPress Theme Grunt Plugin

Do you think that defining your WordPress theme in a comment at the top of
`style.css` is weird? Yeah, I do too.  This grunt plugin will build the
`style.css` file for you based on a `theme.json` file and append concatenated
css files.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install grunt-wptheme --save-dev
```

## Documentation

Coming soon.
